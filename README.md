# str-to-int
Suppose you have a string input that represents a list of integers separated by commas. Write a C# program that parses the input string, calculates the sum of the even integers in the list, and then generates an output string that lists the even integers along with their squares in the format "number^2 = square".
For example, if the input string is "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6", the program should output the string "2^2 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 6^2 = 36".
